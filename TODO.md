## Medium Effort (2-4 hours)
- [x] Change weekly progress to show number of questions learned
- [x] Redesign study page to be single-page without scrolling
- [x] Add info/help section explaining app logic and mastery system
- [x] Add dedicated quit button in study mode with summary popup
- [x] **Mobile UX optimization** - Touch targets, spacing, thumb zone design
- [ ] **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Add service worker and app manifest for mobile installation
- [ ] **Offline mode** - Cache questions for study without internet connection

## Completed Highlights

- Full Anki algorithm and time-based grading
- Mobile-first study experience and gestures (partial)
- Keyboard shortcuts and topic selection persistence
- Browse, Dashboard, Info implemented per PRD

## Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Remove difficulty column** - Replaced with learning status (new/learning/mature)
   - Updated API to calculate status based on repetitions and interval
   - Updated Browse component to show status instead of difficulty
   - Status categories:
     - New: Never studied (repetitions = 0)
     - Learning: Being actively reviewed (interval < 21 days)
     - Mature: Well-known (interval >= 21 days)

2. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Added for faster question answering
   - Press 1-4 or A-D to select answers
   - Press Enter or Space to move to next question
   - Visual hints added to show keyboard options

3. **Persist topic selection** - Topics now saved between sessions
   - Selected topics stored in localStorage via Zustand
   - Topics automatically pre-selected on next visit
   - Improved user experience with consistent preferences

4. **Mobile-first study experience** (Latest - January 2025)
   - **Separate mobile/desktop components** - StudySessionMobile.tsx with touch-optimized UI
   - **Responsive device detection** - Automatic mobile/desktop switching based on screen size and touch capability
   - **Header hiding on mobile** - Main navigation hidden during active study for maximum content area
   - **Touch-optimized design** - 60px+ touch targets, thumb zone optimization, active feedback
   - **Improved navigation** - Back button with arrow icon instead of intimidating "Quit" button
   - **Swipe gestures** - Right swipe for next question navigation
   - **Shared business logic** - useStudySession hook prevents code duplication between platforms
   - **Enhanced mobile layout** - Compact spacing, optimized for portrait orientation
   - **Safe area support** - Works properly with device notches and home indicators

5. **Advanced Spaced Repetition System** (Latest - January 2025)
   - **Full Anki Algorithm** - Complete implementation with learning states, relearning, scientific scheduling
   - **Time-based Auto-grading** - Suggests quality based on response time (10/20/40/120s thresholds)
   - **5-state Learning System** - New ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Young ‚Üí Mature ‚Üí Relearning progression
   - **Configurable Learning Steps** - Short-term repetition before graduation (1min, 10min)
   - **Advanced Ease Adjustments** - Precise ease factor modifications (-20pp, -15pp, +15pp)
   - **Card State Management** - Proper tracking of learning progress and lapses

### üöß In Progress
- None currently

### üìù Notes
- **Full Anki Algorithm implemented** - Not just SM-2, but complete Anki-style spaced repetition with learning states
- **5-state progression** - New ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Young ‚Üí Mature ‚Üí Relearning based on performance and time
- **Time-based grading** - Auto-suggests quality based on response speed (10/20/40/120s thresholds)
- **Mobile-first design** - Research-backed UX principles (49% one-handed usage, Material Design touch targets)
- **Modern architecture** - Shared hooks, responsive detection, supports PWA/offline features
- **Individual card tracking** - Each question has its own learning state and review schedule

## Cleanup Phases (active)

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Immediate hygiene (DONE)
- [x] Standardize Prisma usage via `lib/prisma` in all API routes
- [x] Set HttpOnly `session-token` cookie in auth login route
- [x] Update PRD and TODO dates/status to September 2025
- [x] Create `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (note: original deployment guide will be consolidated under docs)

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Docs consolidation
- [x] Move product docs to `/docs/` and link from README
- [x] Create `rules/README.md` and archive detailed doctrine files
- [x] Move UI/UX and cleanup proposals into `/docs`

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Algorithm module consolidation and performance
- [ ] Create `lib/anki/index.ts` and update imports
- [ ] Deprecate or re-export from `lib/spaced-repetition.ts`
- [ ] Optimize `app/api/stats/route.ts` with batched aggregations

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Technical cleanup
- [ ] Remove unused deps after confirming usage (`pdfjs-dist`, `bcryptjs`, `@vercel/postgres`, `date-fns`, `puppeteer`)
- [ ] Remove `canvas`/`encoding` webpack aliases if unneeded
- [ ] Add/update `.env.example` and deployment docs

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Enhancements
- [ ] Add basic rate limiting to auth/answer routes
- [ ] Add "due selection" endpoint using scheduler
