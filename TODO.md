- [ ] **Voice control** - Accessibility feature for hands-free study
- [ ] **Study reminders** - Push notifications for due reviews

## Current Progress

### ✅ Completed
1. **Remove difficulty column** - Replaced with learning status (new/learning/mature)
   - Updated API to calculate status based on repetitions and interval
   - Updated Browse component to show status instead of difficulty
   - Status categories:
     - New: Never studied (repetitions = 0)
     - Learning: Being actively reviewed (interval < 21 days)
     - Mature: Well-known (interval >= 21 days)

2. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Added for faster question answering
   - Press 1-4 or A-D to select answers
   - Press Enter or Space to move to next question
   - Visual hints added to show keyboard options

3. **Persist topic selection** - Topics now saved between sessions
   - Selected topics stored in localStorage via Zustand
   - Topics automatically pre-selected on next visit
   - Improved user experience with consistent preferences

4. **Mobile-first study experience** (Latest - January 2025)
   - **Separate mobile/desktop components** - StudySessionMobile.tsx with touch-optimized UI
   - **Responsive device detection** - Automatic mobile/desktop switching based on screen size and touch capability
   - **Header hiding on mobile** - Main navigation hidden during active study for maximum content area
   - **Touch-optimized design** - 60px+ touch targets, thumb zone optimization, active feedback
   - **Improved navigation** - Back button with arrow icon instead of intimidating "Quit" button
   - **Swipe gestures** - Right swipe for next question navigation
   - **Shared business logic** - useStudySession hook prevents code duplication between platforms
   - **Enhanced mobile layout** - Compact spacing, optimized for portrait orientation
   - **Safe area support** - Works properly with device notches and home indicators

5. **Advanced Spaced Repetition System** (Latest - January 2025)
   - **Full Anki Algorithm** - Complete implementation with learning states, relearning, scientific scheduling
   - **Time-based Auto-grading** - Suggests quality based on response time (10/20/40/120s thresholds)
   - **5-state Learning System** - New → Learning → Young → Mature → Relearning progression
   - **Configurable Learning Steps** - Short-term repetition before graduation (1min, 10min)
   - **Advanced Ease Adjustments** - Precise ease factor modifications (-20pp, -15pp, +15pp)
   - **Card State Management** - Proper tracking of learning progress and lapses
