# DECA Study App - TODO List

## Quick Wins (1-2 hours each)
- [x] Remove difficulty column and replace with learning status (new/learning/mature)
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for answering questions (1-4 or A-D)
- [x] Save and persist topic selection across sessions

## Medium Effort (2-4 hours)
- [x] Change weekly progress to show number of questions learned
- [x] Redesign study page to be single-page without scrolling
- [x] Add info/help section explaining app logic and mastery system
- [x] Add dedicated quit button in study mode with summary popup

## Anki Algorithm Implementation (21-31 hours)

### High Priority - Spaced Repetition Enhancement
- [ ] **Replace SM-2 with Anki Algorithm** - Implement proper learning states, relearning system, and more scientific scheduling
- [ ] **Add Time-Based Answer Grading** - Suggest Easy/Good/Hard based on response time (10/20/40/120 second thresholds)
- [ ] **Database Schema Updates** - Add state, currentStep, lapses fields to QuestionStat model
- [ ] **Learning Steps System** - Implement configurable short-term steps before cards become mature
- [ ] **Enhanced Answer Processing** - Specific ease factor adjustments per answer type (-20pp, -15pp, +15pp)

*See ANKI_ALGORITHM_PROPOSAL.md for detailed specifications*

## Other Features (4+ hours)
- [ ] Create review mode for missed questions
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality in Browse mode
- [ ] Create practice test mode with full 100-question exams

## Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Remove difficulty column** - Replaced with learning status (new/learning/mature)
   - Updated API to calculate status based on repetitions and interval
   - Updated Browse component to show status instead of difficulty
   - Status categories:
     - New: Never studied (repetitions = 0)
     - Learning: Being actively reviewed (interval < 21 days)
     - Mature: Well-known (interval >= 21 days)

2. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Added for faster question answering
   - Press 1-4 or A-D to select answers
   - Press Enter or Space to move to next question
   - Visual hints added to show keyboard options

3. **Persist topic selection** - Topics now saved between sessions
   - Selected topics stored in localStorage via Zustand
   - Topics automatically pre-selected on next visit
   - Improved user experience with consistent preferences

### üöß In Progress
- None currently

### üìù Notes
- Learning status is based on spaced repetition algorithm
- Questions progress: New ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mature based on performance
- Interval determines review schedule (days until next review)
