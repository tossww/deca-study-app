- [ ] Create API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/questions/star` - Add/remove star
  - `GET /api/questions/starred` - Get all starred questions for user
  - `GET /api/questions?mode=starred` - Fetch starred questions for study

**Phase 2 - UI Components**
- [ ] Add star icon button to StudySession and StudySessionMobile
  - Position: Top-right corner of question card

## üìã Existing Plan: Mastery System Improvements

### Overview
Improve the mastery system to better communicate when users have truly mastered questions and provide clearer feedback on learning progress.

**Reference Document**: [`docs/MASTERY_SYSTEM_IMPROVEMENTS.md`](./docs/MASTERY_SYSTEM_IMPROVEMENTS.md)

### Key Issues to Address
- **"Review" state** doesn't clearly indicate mastery level
- **Users can't tell** when they've truly mastered a question
- **No clear progression** from learning to mastery
- **Technical complexity** with redundant variables

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] **Enhanced State Display**: Show mastery level instead of just "review"
- [ ] **Clear Mastery Criteria**: 3+ reviews, high ease factor, long intervals
- [ ] **Visual Indicators**: Progress bars, colors, icons for mastery levels
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Celebration messages for mastery achievements
- [ ] **Variable Simplification**: Reduce from 11 to 8 variables

- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Add error boundaries and better error handling
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Add data export functionality (CSV, Anki format)
- [ ] Performance monitoring and analytics

## üìÖ Implementation Priority
1. **Starred Questions** - Most requested, relatively simple
2. **Personal Notes** - High value for learning
3. **Wrong Answers List** - Helps identify weak areas
4. **Mastery System Improvements** - Better UX but more complex
