   - **Separate mobile/desktop components** - StudySessionMobile.tsx with touch-optimized UI
   - **Responsive device detection** - Automatic mobile/desktop switching based on screen size and touch capability
   - **Header hiding on mobile** - Main navigation hidden during active study for maximum content area
   - **Touch-optimized design** - 60px+ touch targets, thumb zone optimization, active feedback
   - **Improved navigation** - Back button with arrow icon instead of intimidating "Quit" button
   - **Swipe gestures** - Right swipe for next question navigation
   - **Shared business logic** - useStudySession hook prevents code duplication between platforms

   - **Safe area support** - Works properly with device notches and home indicators

5. **Advanced Spaced Repetition System** (Latest - January 2025)
   - **Full Anki Algorithm** - Complete implementation with learning states, relearning, scientific scheduling
   - **Time-based Auto-grading** - Suggests quality based on response time (10/20/40/120s thresholds)
   - **5-state Learning System** - New ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Young ‚Üí Mature ‚Üí Relearning progression
   - **Configurable Learning Steps** - Short-term repetition before graduation (1min, 10min)
   - **Advanced Ease Adjustments** - Precise ease factor modifications (-20pp, -15pp, +15pp)
   - **Card State Management** - Proper tracking of learning progress and lapses

### üöß In Progress
- None currently

### üìù Notes
- **Full Anki Algorithm implemented** - Not just SM-2, but complete Anki-style spaced repetition with learning states
- **5-state progression** - New ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Young ‚Üí Mature ‚Üí Relearning based on performance and time
- **Time-based grading** - Auto-suggests quality based on response speed (10/20/40/120s thresholds)
- **Mobile-first design** - Research-backed UX principles (49% one-handed usage, Material Design touch targets)
- **Modern architecture** - Shared hooks, responsive detection, supports PWA/offline features
- **Individual card tracking** - Each question has its own learning state and review schedule

## Cleanup Phases (active)

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Immediate hygiene (DONE)
- [x] Standardize Prisma usage via `lib/prisma` in all API routes
- [x] Set HttpOnly `session-token` cookie in auth login route
- [x] Update PRD and TODO dates/status to September 2025
- [x] Create `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (note: original deployment guide will be consolidated under docs)

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Docs consolidation
- [x] Move product docs to `/docs/` and link from README
- [x] Create `rules/README.md` and archive detailed doctrine files
- [x] Move UI/UX and cleanup proposals into `/docs`

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Algorithm module consolidation and performance
- [ ] Create `lib/anki/index.ts` and update imports
- [ ] Deprecate or re-export from `lib/spaced-repetition.ts`
- [ ] Optimize `app/api/stats/route.ts` with batched aggregations

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Technical cleanup
- [ ] Remove unused deps after confirming usage (`pdfjs-dist`, `bcryptjs`, `@vercel/postgres`, `date-fns`, `puppeteer`)
- [ ] Remove `canvas`/`encoding` webpack aliases if unneeded
- [ ] Add/update `.env.example` and deployment docs

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Enhancements
- [ ] Add basic rate limiting to auth/answer routes
- [ ] Add "due selection" endpoint using scheduler

## üö® Critical Fix: Implement Two Study Modes (Test vs Review)

### Current Issue
The app currently loads ALL questions from selected topics (100+) without option for shorter review sessions using spaced repetition.

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Topic Selector UI Update (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Replace single "Start Study" button with two options:
  - [ ] "Test All" - Current behavior, all questions from topics
  - [ ] "Study (25)" - Limited session with SRS selection
- [ ] Pass study mode ('test' or 'study') to session component
- [ ] Show configurable count on Study button
- [ ] Store last selected mode in localStorage

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Settings in Info Panel (1 hour)
- [ ] Add "Session Settings" section to InfoHelp component
- [ ] Add number input for study session size (min: 5, max: 100, default: 25)
- [ ] Save preference to localStorage via store
- [ ] Update Study button label dynamically with saved preference
- [ ] Add explanation of difference between Test and Study modes

### Phase 3 ‚Äì API & Session Logic (2 hours)
- [ ] Update `/api/questions` endpoint to accept `mode` and `limit` parameters
- [ ] Test mode: return all questions (current behavior)
- [ ] Study mode:
  - [ ] Filter by nextReview <= today for reviews
  - [ ] Include new questions (repetitions = 0)
  - [ ] Priority: overdue > due > new
  - [ ] Limit to requested session size
- [ ] Update useStudySession hook to pass mode and limit

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Polish & Feedback (1 hour)
- [ ] Show mode indicator in study session header
- [ ] Different completion messages for Test vs Study
- [ ] Add "Continue Studying" option after Study mode completion
- [ ] Track separate stats for Test vs Study sessions
