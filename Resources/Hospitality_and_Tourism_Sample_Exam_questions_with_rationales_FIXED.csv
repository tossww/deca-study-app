A chain of hotels might analyze and interpret the marketing information contained in databases in order to compare several variables that change from property to property. For example, one hotel might be located in an affluent suburb while another one is located in an urban area. The chain might analyze the information in its database concerning both communities in order to make appropriate marketing decisions such as the types of services to offer in each location. Although the chain provides the same types of goods and services to both communities, it needs to analyze data in order to know if the consumers in each community have different wants and needs. Before analyzing databases to compare variables, a chain of hotels might survey guests and tabulate the findings. A chain would not analyze databases in order to organize products."

It was once thought that everyone needed eight hours of sleep every night. Studies now indicate that is not true. While the amount of sleep you get will affect your health, you have to determine what amount is right for you. Going to bed early may give you an adequate amount of rest, but it does not guarantee the amount of sleep you will get."

When preparing to deliver an oral presentation, practicing the delivery is most important because it uncovers any problems with timing, transitions, note cards, visual aids, and even language. Conducting research, writing useful note cards, and choosing the best visual aid are all important steps, but they do not affect other areas as much as practice does."

Motivation is the process of getting employees to strive to achieve management's objectives because they want to achieve them. Emmie is motivating her employees by offering them praise when they achieve high-quality work. Paying attention to what time employees clock in, team-building activities, and asking an employee to stay late to finish a project are not necessarily examples of motivation."

Brand insistence is the final stage of brand loyalty in which consumers insist upon buying a specific brand. Brand awareness is one of the first stages of branding and is the extent to which customers or potential customers are familiar with a brand.

Brand recognition is the stage of brand loyalty in which consumers are made aware of a brand's existence.

References are often provided once requested by the employer and are not necessary in a letter of application. Only relevant information should be presented in the letter of application. The ages of the applicant's children and reasons for a partner's frequent job changes are not considered relevant for most job openings.

This is an example of a,private brand.,touchpoint.,logo.,brand cue.,D,brand cue.,"Brand cue. Brand cues are simple reminders of the brand's identity and values. Brand cues are a great way to remind employees about the brand values and brand promise.

Invoice tracking software makes it easy to manage invoices automatically and integrate the invoicing process with the rest of business operations. Only accepting electronic payments will not necessarily make it easier to track invoices. Limiting a client base is not necessarily a smart business decision and will not help the business grow. Reminding clients of deadlines is a good idea, but it will not necessarily make the tracking process easier."

Basically, prices are set in a market economy by the amount of a product available for sale (supply) and the amount that is desired by the market (demand). Governments set prices in command economies. Competition in a market economy affects price but doesn't control it.

Personal selling is planned, personalized communication intended to influence purchase decisions. It is often used with high-priced or complex items. Advertising can be used to attract people to the business but is not generally used by salespeople.

Stress can lead to absenteeism and tardiness at work. When absent workers are the norm, employers have a hard time relying on employees, adhering to deadlines, and getting work done. Employers, therefore, should take steps to limit employee stress as much as they can. High stress in the workplace also leads to decreased productivity, increased health care costs, and higher employee turnover."
1291,HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM CLUSTER EXAM,Hospitality and Tourism Sample Exam.pdf,17,One of the best ways to demonstrate exemplary customer service in the hospitality and tourism industry is to,offer discounts.,be frugal.,waive late fees.,be proactive.,D,be proactive.,"Be proactive. While businesses should do everything they can to resolve customer issues once they are received, it's also important to anticipate any issues to improve the customer experience. Anticipating these issues—or being proactive—helps prevent the customer from having a negative experience. While offering discounts or waiving late fees can be a nice touch, these actions don't take the place of strong customer service. Being frugal involves aiming to spend only a small amount of money when possible. Being smart with money is advantageous to businesses, but being frugal all of the time does not help businesses offer exemplary customer service."

Floods and storms can cause damage that shuts down lodging facilities, restaurants, tourist attractions, airports, and roads. When businesses are not operating and generating income, the local economy is negatively impacted. Occasional airline delays and minor fluctuations in gasoline prices are normal, so these factors do not typically negatively affect a community's economic health.

Because each business owner's situation is unique, the owner must consider the type of business being operated, the amount of capital needed to start the business, and the owner's personal circumstances. For example, an independently wealthy, single person who starts a consulting business has different needs than a chef who has little capital and wants to open a full- service restaurant. Product versatility, advertising strategies, and product mix are not generally considered when determining the appropriate business ownership structure."

1291,HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM CLUSTER EXAM,Hospitality and Tourism Sample Exam.pdf,21,Employees can help prevent losses from price-ticket switching by,putting individual price tickets on goods.,being familiar with regular product prices.,using more than one price ticket on goods.,using cost codes on all price tickets.,B,being familiar with regular product prices.,Being familiar with regular product prices. Employees who are familiar with regular prices will notice an item that seems to be priced too low. They can take a moment to verify the price without offending an honest customer. A dishonest customer will realize the business is watching for attempts at fraud. The use of cost codes on price tickets and the use of more than one price ticket are not effective prevention practices because price-ticket switching can still go unnoticed if employees are not familiar with the prices. Not using price tickets on items creates unfavorable shopping conditions for customers and requires additional time for salespeople to check prices.
1291,HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM CLUSTER EXAM,Hospitality and Tourism Sample Exam.pdf,22,"When is the best time for a front-desk hotel employee to recommend hospitality services, such as dining and exercise facilities, to a hotel guest?",During checkout,After posting charges,After posting credits,During check-in,D,During check-in,"During check-in. Hotel employees should inform guests of the hotel's services and amenities during the check- in process. Guests who are not aware that the hotel offers certain services will not use them, which can affect the guests' experience during their stay and can affect the hotel's sales. For example, a guest who does not realize that the hotel has an on-site restaurant will not dine there. As a result, the hotel's food and beverage division loses potential revenue. Advising guests about services during checkout is not beneficial to the guest or to the hotel. Posting is a term that describes adding or subtracting charges to a guest's bill."

In this situation, a __________ influence is guiding Monika's buying behavior.",psychological,social,cultural,situational,D,situational,"Situational. There are times when specific situations can override the more dominant influences on buying behavior, such as culture or personality. While Monika might not normally spend money when dining out, she made an exception in this case because it was a special occasion: her sister's birthday. Psychological influence involves a consumer's perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes within their own reality. Social interactions have a strong effect on your buying behavior, as much of what you know about making purchases you've learned by watching family and friends. The most significant influence on buying behavior is culture, which is the system of values, traditions, and preferences that is handed down from one generation to the next."

Pricing is like a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Both are trying to get the most value from the good or service. The trick to pricing comes in balancing and satisfying both groups. Both buyers and sellers need to perceive that they are getting the best possible value they can. If this doesn't happen, customers may spend their money elsewhere, either on a similar product (if one is available) or on an entirely different product. A business may make less money if both buyers and sellers don't think that they are getting the best possible value. Customers are not likely to continue to buy the product, and the business is not likely to sell more of the product."

Automobiles, airplanes, roads, and highway systems have made travel faster and easier and increased individuals' mobility. As a result, the demand for hospitality services has increased because more people are traveling for business and pleasure.

When preparing a business report, it is often a good idea to include a table of contents, the portion of a document in which the sections are listed with their page numbers for easy navigation. This allows a reader to sift through a lengthy document to find the needed information. While title pages, introductions, and appendices are also helpful in a written business report, their main purposes are not to make it easier to find specific information."

A repertory grid captures and rates knowledge in a table. Knowledge managers use the table to categorize similar or related variables, concepts, or properties. A concept map organizes concepts and their relationships in a graphic format.

Many cybersecurity breaches occur because of human error from within an organization. Employees may unwittingly leak sensitive customer data or fall prey to internal phishing scams. For this reason, it is essential that hospitality and tourism companies implement cybersecurity training for employees. Employees should be educated on the proper handling of private information as well as how to recognize signs of suspicious activity. Companies should not simply trust that employees will adequately protect customer data; they should educate their employees so that they are properly prepared. At the same time, they should not assume that employees are completely incapable of protecting customer data. Most employees are willing and able to learn how to better protect customer data. Lie detector tests are not typically used when hiring employees."

The readers are more likely to respond favorably to the message if they know how the action will impact or help them. Communicating benefits is a central element to all types of persuasive messages. The beginning of the message should catch the readers' attention and encourage them to read more. Depending on the type of message, this might involve a quote. The message should be concise, so it should not contain unimportant information. The message should be written to communicate the business's goals rather than personal ones."

Confidentiality refers to the agreement of an individual or party not to share the sensitive information of another individual or party. Most lawyers have confidentiality agreements with their clients that protect the sensitive details of the clients' cases from being shared with others. While similar to confidentiality, privacy and security differ in important ways. Privacy is the right of an individual to keep their information to themselves, while security is the protection of sensitive data or items that are housed in a database or other storage facility.

When a company receives a negative review on social media, it should use the platform to publicly acknowledge the customer. This gives the customer the attention and respect they are seeking, as well as demonstrating that the company cares about its customers. The company should not ignore the negative comment because this makes it appear that the customer's opinion does not matter. Replying with a witty comment will not necessarily improve brand image because the customer might feel insulted or belittled. While it is a good idea to gather more information about the problem, it might be wise for the company to do so privately rather than publicly in a comment."

By presenting her data in a pie chart, Hannah helped her managers understand the most important takeaways from the data set. There are disadvantages to using charts, graphs, and tables, too. For example, these visuals can often make complicated issues seem less important than they truly are, leading the audience to miss out on the complexity of the problem or issue at hand. Similarly, charts, tables, and graphs do not allow the audience to absorb all of the details and intricacies of the data set being presented. In other words, they do not provide the audience with the “full picture.”"

Biking reduces car pollution. When others see the company's employees riding their bikes, it reinforces the company's image as environmentally friendly. The company is encouraging this behavior by offering a reward. A bonus of $500 for finishing a project early may be important to employees and effective in motivating them to work efficiently, but it is not seen by others outside the organization so it doesn't reinforce the company's image. In addition, finishing early is not an activity that is perceived as environmentally friendly. Although recycling does reinforce the ""green"" image, there are two problems with this response. First, those outside the company aren't likely to see employees recycling, so it won't boost the company's image. Second, airplanes pollute the environment, so the award is not aligned with the company's green image. The luncheon may motivate employees to turn in reports in a timely manner, but nothing about this incentive or reward reinforces the company's environmentally friendly image."

Heather writing a positive review of the phone case and sharing the information with her family members, friends, and colleagues is an example of the ultimate moment of truth. The ultimate moment of truth is the final stage in shaping a meaningful experience for the customer. It is when the customer begins to share their experiences with others and thus creates more zero moments of truth (the first possible moment of contact between a brand or product and the customer). When a problem arises, the customer will go searching for a solution. The first moment of truth occurs when the potential customer first comes into contact with a specific product. It focuses on the impression they form when they see the product for the first time and learn more about it. The second moment of truth takes place when the customer truly experiences what the company is offering.

If the writer uses language that is very casual, personal, or questionable, there is a risk of offending the recipient or others to whom the recipient forwards the message. Because many businesses have email policies and can monitor the contents of emails going into and out of their companies, email writers should take care not to send inappropriate messages.

Identity theft occurs when somebody uses another individual's name and personal information (e.g., credit cards) for fraudulent purposes. Identity theft can occur even when you take precautions. To reduce the risk of identity theft, use unusual passwords to access your personal bank accounts rather than common information such as your birth date. To further prevent identity theft, do not place your Social Security number on unnecessary documents. Many people do not have passports. Paying with cash is not always a good idea, because cancelled bank checks serve as a receipt for payments. If you pay your bills by sending cash, the envelope may get lost, and you will have no record of making the payment. In addition, using credit cards wisely can help you build a good credit report, which will help you obtain loans for expensive items (e.g., a car) in the future."

Sometimes, frustrated customers want to complain and release anger. Allowing them to express their feelings might help them calm down and make a resolution more likely. Agreeing with a customer's complaints is not a good idea, because it undermines the authority of the company.

Employee turnover can become a problem during peaks in demand, when employees (such as the manager in this example) become overworked and stressed. This issue could have been avoided by increasing staffing to meet demand. Hiring a more responsible manager might not necessarily help, because there still might not be enough staff to handle the demands of the busiest seasons. Convincing the manager to stay would also not help with the excessive demand unless other staff members were hired to help as well. Closing down the resort during peaks in demand is not a good idea; the resort would lose revenue and would likely struggle to stay in business."

Primary research is that which a person or company generates on their own for their exact needs and purposes. Primary research is generally done when the needed information does not exist yet.

If the airline has little money for research, the executive might be better off focusing on secondary research because it is cheaper than primary research."

To make the assignment easier for everyone, the group decided that each team member would write their own section of the report.

They should not have written an entire report each and chosen the best report to submit; that would be a waste of time and resources. It would be inappropriate to ask their supervisor for different projects rather than following directions."

To identify its competitive advantage, a business must consider what makes its service, product, capability, or other resource superior to all of a customer's other choices—in other words, what gives that service, product, capability, or resource greater value in the market.

Service marketers that choose to double the value of coupons must make up the difference between the face value printed on the coupon and the doubled amount. Customers do not get mad when their coupons are not taken from them because it offers them another opportunity to enjoy a discounted price. If anything, accepting a coupon would slightly slow down the transaction time because the discount must be entered into the register; however, the amount of time is negligible."
