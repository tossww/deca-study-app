Cost allocation refers to the process of identifying, assigning, and accumulating costs to a company's cost objects. Cost objects are any activity or item to which a company assigns costs, which can be a product or product line, a project, or a department. Cost allocation helps a company determine which parts of a business are responsible for which costs by spreading costs among departments (not just one department). This process can help a company make better-informed decisions, both in the short term and the long term. Companies that effectively allocate costs typically increase their profits and lower their expenses. They do this by determining which cost objects are most profitable. If a cost object is not profitable and is causing the business to pay more expenses, then the company would do further evaluations on it."

A mortgage is a type of secured loan, meaning the borrower pledges to the lender some valuable possession as collateral, or security, to guarantee that the loan will be repaid. In the case of a mortgage, the collateral is almost always the home itself. Lenders order appraisals of homes to ensure the property—the collateral—is worth the risk. If you don't repay the mortgage, the lender has the right to foreclose the home, meaning you'll lose the collateral. Although your car, cash in your savings account, and future paychecks are common forms of collateral for personal loans, they are not typically used for mortgages."

Cyclical unemployment occurs during periods of time when there is low demand for workers due to economic conditions and fluctuations in the business cycle. When the economy slows, consumer spending tends to fall, which causes many businesses to decrease production. When production decreases, there is not enough work for employees, so businesses implement layoffs, which causes unemployment to rise. Lizzy's situation is an example of seasonal unemployment. Seasonal unemployment occurs when people are out of work because of factors that involve the time of year. Frictional unemployment describes people who are temporarily between jobs due to layoffs, resignations, or educational pursuits, as is the case in Hannah's situation. Structural unemployment results when people do not have the job skills for jobs that currently exist. These people often have skills and training needed to work but are unemployed due to factors such as technological advancements or lacking natural resources (e.g., depleted coal mine)."

The formula for a statement of changes in equity is: beginning earnings + net income - dividends = retained earnings. If dividends are higher than net income, retained earnings will be lower than beginning earnings. In order for retained earnings to stay the same, the net income would have to be exactly equal to the dividend payments. For retained earnings to be higher than the previous period, net income would have to exceed dividends. For retained earnings to equal zero, the dividend payments would have to be equal to the beginning earnings and net income would have to be zero."

One of the best ways to differentiate a business from the competition is by offering excellent customer service.

When investments such as stocks, bonds, and real estate are sold at a profit, a capital gains tax may be levied. A capital gain is the difference between the purchase price and sales price of an asset. Investors can reduce their capital gains taxes in a number of ways, including selling some investments at a loss to offset the profit generated by the sale of other investments. Capital gains taxes can also be reduced by keeping investments for a longer length of time. Short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate than long-term and super-long-term capital gains. The capital gain generated by a real estate sale is often not taxed if the seller owned the home for at least 2 years. A gift tax, not a capital gains tax, may be imposed on financial gifts."

Businesses are constantly looking for ways to use their resources more efficiently. Two popular methods of achieving this goal are lean operations (manufacturing) and Six Sigma. The lean-operations method involves eliminating waste (the ineffective use of resources) to improve efficiency. According to the lean- operations philosophy, when efficiency increases, the business will have fewer errors, which leads to higher profits. Six Sigma is a quality-management framework that involves continuously setting higher goals of perfection. The Six Sigma framework builds upon previous goals to set higher goals, which continuously improves the quality of the business's goods, services, or processes. The ultimate goal is to maximize outputs, have no process or product defects, and minimize production costs. Therefore, an important aspect of the Six Sigma philosophy is to continuously lower costs while improving quality. Lean operations do not focus on reducing wages, automation, or standards. Six Sigma does not focus on improving waste."

If you must use credit cards, the most effective way to avoid excessive credit card debt is to pay off your balance each month. By paying back what you've borrowed each month, you can avoid paying interest and other costly fees. If you cannot pay off your balance each month, work to pay off high- interest credit cards first since high-interest credit cards cost you more in the long run than low-interest cards. Choose credit cards with low limits so that you have less of an opportunity to accumulate debt. Credit card cash advances usually result in extremely high interest charges, often 20% or more. So, it is wise to avoid cash advances, rather than using them to pay debt."

The organizations that form the captive insurance companies control insurance activities including the underwriting processes, premium rates, and claims processing policies. Acquiring a professional association, establishing a risk management committee, and creating a trade union are not ways in which a business transfers risk."

Stereotypes are set images or assumptions about a person, group of people, or thing. Stereotypes are often widely recognized by a society as a whole. For example, the idea that only men enjoy watching sports is a stereotype. Prejudice is an opinion or judgment that is based on feeling or hearsay, rather than fact. Unconscious bias is bias that we are unaware of and unable to control. This type of bias happens automatically through the quick judgments we make. A discriminatory statement would involve discrimination, or unfair treatment of a person or group based on the person's or group's characteristics. This example best demonstrates a stereotype, not prejudice, unconscious bias, or a discriminatory statement."

Marginal analysis can be used to make many types of decisions. One type of decision that it can be used for is a segment profitability decision, which is the process of deciding if it is more profitable to keep or drop an unsuccessful segment of the business. The restaurant manager must decide if the franchise (a segment of their business) is profitable enough to remain open. The clothing retailer who must decide how many units of each product to sell is making a sales mix decision. A company deciding whether to use an outside marketing firm or hire someone internally is making a make-or-buy decision. The furniture company deciding whether or not to assemble its pieces before sale is making a sell-or-process-further decision. All of these cases can benefit from marginal analysis."

One of the biggest benefits and motivations for a bank to acquire another is to gain large numbers of new customers. When a bank acquires another one, it does not transfer any of its financial risk, but instead assumes any financial risk belonging to the newly acquired bank. When two banks merge, they should seek to streamline the way they handle federal banking regulations to avoid negative impacts on profits. However, they cannot avoid or eliminate federal banking regulations completely. A bank does not have the ability to decrease the federal interest rate."

Corporate governance consists of various rules, processes, and duties that direct and manage a corporation. A company's board of directors is the primary force influencing corporate governance, as the board is responsible for making important decisions and representing shareholders. In addition, the board must ensure the company's corporate governance policies incorporate risk management, ethical business practices, corporate strategy, environmental awareness, etc. Boards are often made up of insiders (shareholders, founders, and executives) and independent directors (managers or directors of other large corporations). Chief executive officers (CEOs), shareholders, and independent directors can each be members of a board of directors, but the board as a whole is the primary force influencing a company's corporate governance, not an individual member or group of members. In some cases, a CEO may be a member of a board of directors. However, CEOs are typically selected and overseen by a board. Shareholders are important stakeholders that indirectly affect governance, as members of a board of directors are elected by shareholders. Independent directors are chosen due to their experience managing or directing other large corporations, and they help dilute the concentration of power by aligning shareholder and insider interests."

It is illegal to be in possession of a medication, even if it is a legal medication, if you do not have a prescription for it. Missing school for a family vacation will not lead to a legal penalty. Missing too much school is breaking a law, but a couple of days is not a criminal offense. While people are allowed to file noise complaints that can lead to legal penalties, an amusement park is a place where noise is expected, so you will not be penalized as long as you are not creating a disturbance or being unsafe. You have the right to refuse to speak when a police officer questions you, so it should not lead to a legal penalty."

The use of company resources is one of the main causes of financial risk. Even when people are not intending to take advantage of the company, it can be easy to get caught up in activities that are a strain on resources, including company time. If Yazmin leaves her shift early without clocking out, she is misusing company resources and putting the company at risk. Paying for a business lunch with a company credit card, flying first class for work travel, or taking notepads from the supply closet are not necessarily examples of misusing company resources as long as they are in line with company policies."

1312,FINANCE CLUSTER EXAM,Finance Sample Exam.pdf,88,"Lawrence's manager asked him to prepare a visual representation of key performance indicators, including cash flow, liquidity, profitability, and liability. Lawrence should use his company's analytic software to create a(n)",operating agreement.,financial scorecard.,cost standard.,profit-and-loss statement.,B,financial scorecard.,"Financial scorecard. Many financial analysis applications include the capability to create financial scorecards containing key financial indicators and up-to-date financial information. Cash flow, liquidity, profitability, and liability are examples of metrics that are often included on a financial scorecard. Rather than simply listing data on the scorecard, business employees can use financial analysis applications to develop charts and graphs that present the data in much more readily understandable ways. A profit-and-loss statement is a summary of business transactions that shows net profit before and after taxes by analyzing sales, purchases, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses for a specified period. While Lawrence's financial scorecard probably contains information that also appears on the company's profit-and-loss statement, the financial scorecard presents additional financial metrics. Cost standards are established specifications used to measure how much a project or product costs. An operating agreement is a written document signed by members of a limited liability partnership or limited liability company that specifies the terms of the business arrangement."

An audit is the process by which an organization’s accounts and records are verified.

Because auditors will have digital access to the data and documents, they do not need printed copies. Virtual audits can be done remotely, and they rely on technology."

If Jerry can maintain his self-control in this situation, he will be able to defend himself without losing his temper. He should not take responsibility for something he didn't do or try to put the blame on someone else, as Greg has done. Getting even is seldom a good idea, and Jerry should let the supervisor handle Greg."

Accounting staff typically calculate variances based on monthly accounting reports. However, some businesses find that is too much of a time delay to correct a problem quickly and effectively. In those cases, companies may decide against using variance analysis. Variance analysis is based on tangible, objective data. Real causes can be uncovered with careful variance analysis.

Enterprise risk management is a plan-based business strategy that aims to identify, assess, and prepare for risks across the organization. Therefore, according to this concept, risk should be managed as a part of overall business strategy. Risk should not be managed on a case-by-case basis, because it will not be unified toward supporting the business's overall goals. After an incident has occurred, it is too late to manage risks. While purchasing insurance is one way to manage some risks, it does not cover all the risks that can affect a business."

Employees may be less likely to intentionally tamper with financial data if they know financial audit trails are in place and activities can be monitored and tracked. The primary reason why businesses use financial audit trails is not to ensure that financial reports are prepared quickly or to evaluate profitability ratios."
