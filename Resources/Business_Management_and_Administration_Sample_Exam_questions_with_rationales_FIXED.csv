Administrative law deals with the rules and regulations that have been established by governmental agencies.

Settlement occurs when the defendant in a case agrees to some or all of the plaintiff's claims and decides not to go to court, usually instead paying a monetary amount. Settlement is often a more affordable option than a costly legal battle that the defendant may not even win. Therefore, if a small company is the defendant in a case, it might agree to settle to save money. Settlements can keep companies out of the spotlight, rather than bringing them publicity. If a defendant feels they have a strong chance of winning, they might want to pursue the case in court rather than settling because they could receive a much larger payment. Finally, complicated cases with many defendants are more difficult to settle because some might want to settle while others do not."

Mediation occurs when a neutral third party acts as a mediator between two parties in disagreement. While the mediator cannot make a decision that resolves the disagreement, they can work with both sides to find points of agreement to help provide solution suggestions. This process asks the parties to come together, unlike in litigation, which is often combative and hostile when parties are pitted against each other. Mediation is more flexible than litigation because it does not impose a resolution on both parties. Both mediation and litigation can be personal. The necessity of either mediation or litigation depends on the disagreement."

One of the best strategies for extracting important information from a text is to pay attention to headings, titles, and graphics.

If a caller wants to speak to a specific employee who is unavailable, it is most courteous to ask if you can take a message or ask the caller if they would like to leave a voicemail. There isn't enough information to determine if the caller wants to place an order or if you are in the position to help the caller. If Rhonda is in a meeting or out of the building, putting the caller on hold until you track her down or asking them to call back in a few minutes are not viable options. Additionally, placing a caller on hold for a long time and telling them to call later are rude responses."

A feasibility report summarizes the positive and negative consequences of taking a certain course of action that has not yet occurred. Troubleshooting reports address specific problems, such as an issue with a process.

Businesspeople should try to learn as much as they can about a client's culture, customs, and social values. By understanding and being aware of cultural differences, businesspeople can adapt their communication styles to make a positive impression on their clients, earn their clients' trust, and persuade their clients to buy.

A monopoly exists when a single business influences the entire production of a particular good or service. This means that any major competitors are eliminated, and the monopoly can control the price of the product by restricting production. Government regulates monopolies to protect consumers except in cases in which it is best to have a single provider of a good or service (e.g., utilities). Monopolies do not reduce the power of the government and are not necessarily hard to manage. They do pay taxes."

Net profit is the amount of money left after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profit. Operating expenses are the daily costs of running the business.

Competition encourages new businesses to enter the marketplace. When a product is popular and successful, others recognize the demand and develop similar products in order to compete. The ongoing competition leads to the creation of new products and new companies. Businesses do not necessarily benefit from more regulations. Competition usually encourages the creation of businesses that are similar or related to successful, existing businesses. Many resources are limited, which means that more cannot be created."

Jon is stereotyping on the basis of,ethnicity.,gender.,religion.,age.,B,gender.,"Gender. A stereotype is a set image or assumption about a person or thing. When people stereotype others, they tend to classify certain people as a group that possesses certain characteristics. These characteristics are often based on distorted beliefs or unreliable information. A person who stereotypes others often fails to see an individual who possesses unique skills, values, and attitudes. Gender is one characteristic by which people often stereotype others. Assuming men are more assertive than women in business situations is a distorted belief. In fact, many women are very assertive in business situations. Ethnic stereotyping involves having false beliefs about a person on the basis of their race or culture. Stereotypes about religion involve having distorted beliefs about a person's spiritual practices. An individual who stereotypes by age might feel that younger people do not possess needed knowledge or that older people are feeble and lack adaptability."

Being able to laugh at yourself and at annoying things that happen is very good for your positive attitude. It keeps you from taking yourself too seriously and helps you keep things in perspective. Changing attitudes won't happen overnight. Our attitudes develop from the time we are children, and they can't be changed that easily. Energy is like the common cold—contagious. Surrounding yourself with positive people will have a positive effect on your attitude. Your attitude is one of the few things in life over which you have complete control. The choice to be positive is one you make every day, and no one else can make that decision for you."

Using credit can add to the total cost of goods and services. For example, interest or finance charges are added to accounts that are not paid in full at the end of each payment period. When customers buy products with a credit card, they often pay over a period of time. Then, each month they pay interest on the unpaid balance. The interest charges add to the cost of the purchase. Interest charges do not increase the retail price, because customers who pay in cash are not charged interest. Interest usually is calculated monthly rather than yearly. Interest generates profit for the credit card company rather than the store."

Also, some people set up guardianships to manage assets for minor children. Attorneys usually provide these types of financial services because wills and guardianship papers are legal documents.

When calculating cash flow, companies use income statements and balance sheets to observe how cash is flowing in and out of the company. A negative cash flow does not typically indicate that a company is financially healthy and stable. Generally, a negative cash flow is indicative of financial struggles.

Many times, employees find ways that help them manage their workload—things that aren't always written in their job descriptions. This personal knowledge is acquired by trial and error, which occurs by repeating tasks and activities over time. Personal knowledge might include tips that help the employee work with or around deficit computer processes, or shortcuts that eliminate waste or improve efficiency. If Camilla did not provide these tips, it would likely take Cecily more time to become proficient at her job, which can affect the company's efficiency and ability to achieve its goals. Therefore, Camilla is behaving in an ethical manner by providing Cecily with tips and personal knowledge.

A community of practice is an informal group that is formed by people who have common interests. In communities of practice, group members share ideas, discuss problems, and brainstorm solutions. By doing so, the group members are transferring their knowledge among themselves. One or all members can capture and record the collected knowledge for future personal or group use. In the example, Jack and his friends share a common bond because all of them work in technology. When the group met, Jack's friends offered suggestions for resolving his work dilemma; therefore, the group is a community of practice. Groupthink is a situation that occurs when conforming to the group becomes more important than expressing individual judgment and ideas. A strategic alliance is an arrangement that involves two or more businesses entering into a relationship by combining complementary resources such as technology, skills, capital, or distribution channels for the benefit of all parties; the relationship is usually short-term or for a single project/transaction.
