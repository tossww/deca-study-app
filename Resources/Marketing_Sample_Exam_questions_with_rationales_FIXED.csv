Otherwise, they should be communicated outside the project-status meeting. It is not always necessary to take notes for the group."
1309,MARKETING CLUSTER EXAM,Marketing Sample Exam.pdf,2,Camilla believes that women tend to work more efficiently and focus more on important details than men do. Camilla's personal bias is associated with a stereotype based on,age.,education.,culture.,gender.,D,gender.,"Gender. A stereotype is a set image or assumption about a person or thing. When people stereotype others, they tend to classify certain people as part of a group that possesses certain characteristics. These characteristics are often based on distorted beliefs or unproven information. When people stereotype others, they fail to see an individual who possesses unique skills, values, and attitudes. People stereotype others in a variety of ways, one of which is by gender. Camilla's assumption that women are more efficient and more detail- oriented than men is a distorted belief. In fact, many men in the workplace are very efficient and detail-oriented. A stereotype by age might hold the false belief that most senior citizens are set in their ways or that they don't keep up with technological changes. An assumption about a person's customs, habits, or traditions is a stereotype based on culture. An assumption about a person that is based on their level of education is also a form of stereotyping. For example, assuming a person is not smart because they did not attend college is an educational stereotype and is a belief that simply isn't true."
