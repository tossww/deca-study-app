A cost or benefit that is difficult to measure in dollar amounts is referred to as an intangible. Intangibles include costs and benefits such as increased or decreased employee morale, increased or decreased customer goodwill, etc. One-time costs are expenses the business pays only once when implementing a decision or project.

1287,ENTREPRENEURSHIP EXAM,Entrepreneurship Sample Exam.pdf,2,Which of the following is a benefit of establishing incident reporting procedures in the workplace:,Employees use their judgment to determine if a report should be issued.,Managers who create these procedures are not required to follow up on incidents.,Managers who have information about incidents can investigate possible causes.,Employees cannot file official complaints if an incident is reported correctly.,C,Managers who have information about incidents can investigate possible causes.,"Managers who have information about incidents can investigate possible causes. Establishing procedures for reporting workplace incidents is very important to promoting workplace safety. These procedures should allow for efficient communication of incidents that occur and provide management with the information they need to investigate the factors that led to the incident occurring. Therefore, reporting processes can lead to a decrease in workplace incidents. Incident reporting procedures should provide guidance about what types of incidents need to be reported, taking the decision out of the hands of employees. Although employees can still file complaints about workplace incidents, those incidents that resulted in timely, detailed reports can help clear up any issues about whether or not the company has created a dangerous work environment. Managers should always follow up on incidents that occur in the workplace."

For project managers, the most important part of managing stakeholder expectations is understanding them.

Transition periods are designed to allow you to adjust to your new surroundings over time. By adjusting slowly to his new job duties, Nilesh was less likely to feel overwhelmed. Resource issues occur when you don't have enough of a resource (people, money, information, ideas, and other essential items that are used to produce or do something). Government regulations deal with laws. Emergencies include situations like fires or floods that demand quick action and adaptation by everyone involved."

Personal selling is a form of promotion that determines client needs and wants and responds through planned, personalized communication that influences purchase decisions and enhances future business opportunities. Although developing direct-mail pieces can be expensive, personal selling is generally considered the most expensive promotional method. Micro-marketing is a general term that is sometimes used to describe target marketing. Direct mail (e.g., junk mail, spam) is not necessarily more effective in creating brand awareness than television advertising. Direct mail is used more often with targeted markets, rather than broad audiences."

Customer relationship management is a pull strategy, while trade shows are a push strategy. Push strategies involve promoting products to intermediaries, who then promote the products to customers. Pull strategies involve promoting products directly to the ultimate consumer or industrial user; intermediaries then purchase the products from the manufacturer to meet customer demand. Mass media advertising and sales promotions are both pull strategies. Getting retailers to stock the product and creating a supply chain are both push strategies. Referrals and sales promotions are both pull strategies."

This tactic is known as bargaining, and it can be a highly effective negotiation strategy. Each person proposes solutions and uses ""give-and-take"" tactics to reach an agreement. You may have to give up something, but you get something in return. During negotiations, you should give the salesperson a specific deadline to meet your request. It's a way of making the negotiation real and specific. An advantage to this strategy is that it introduces a deadline as a negotiable point. If you set a deadline earlier than is necessary, you can build in negotiating room. Similarly, if you show no flexibility whatsoever during a negotiation, the other person may decide that it's not worth their time to speak with you."

To determine the cost of goods sold, the beginning inventory and purchases are added together to obtain the goods available for sale. The ending inventory is then subtracted from that amount to obtain the cost of goods sold. In this problem, $250,000 (beginning inventory) + $600,000 (purchases) = $850,000 (goods available for sale) - $200,000 (ending inventory) = $650,000 (cost of goods sold)."
1287,ENTREPRENEURSHIP EXAM,Entrepreneurship Sample Exam.pdf,11,One reason it is important for a business to develop a marketing plan is that the plan,provides guidelines for personnel to meet the company's objectives.,allows the business to focus on short-term goals instead of long-term goals.,reduces the need to implement corrective action or contingency plans.,increases the business's financial security in an unpredictable environment.,A,provides guidelines for personnel to meet the company's objectives.,"Provides guidelines for personnel to meet the company's objectives. A marketing plan is a set of procedures or strategies designed to attract target customers to a business. A comprehensive marketing plan identifies the specific actions and activities that a company will use to attract its target customers. Therefore, the marketing plan provides guidance for employees who are carrying out the marketing activities. Because internal and external factors change, a marketing plan does not reduce the need for a business to develop corrective action or contingency plans, nor does it increase its financial security. Marketing plans contain both short-term and long-term goals."

The cost of building the new wing is an example of a(n)",operating expense.,expense control.,capital expenditure.,budget deficit.,C,capital expenditure.,"Capital expenditure. A capital expenditure is a one-time purchase that a business makes (e.g., land, building, equipment) that will provide long-term benefits in the future. In this case, the veterinarian's addition of a surgical wing will help grow their practice and ultimately result in more opportunity for profit. Operating expenses are the ongoing, day-to-day costs involved in running a business that are not tied to production. A budget deficit occurs when expenditures exceed revenues, which we have no proof of in this scenario. Expense control includes efforts to maintain or reduce a certain level of spending."
1287,ENTREPRENEURSHIP EXAM,Entrepreneurship Sample Exam.pdf,13,One way that a business can learn about its competitors' activities is by,developing product specifications.,reviewing secondary data.,identifying communication barriers.,evaluating intranet efficiencies.,B,reviewing secondary data.,"Reviewing secondary data. By learning about its competitors' markets, products, pricing, and promotional activities, a business can determine its competitors' strengths and weaknesses in the marketplace. By evaluating its competitors' strengths and weaknesses, a business can determine the ways in which it can gain market share. To obtain information about its competitors, the business can collect secondary data, which are information that has been collected for purposes other than the project at hand. Secondary information that the business might review includes its competitors' promotional materials, their products, and industry publications. An intranet is a business's internal computer network. Because a business does not have direct access to its competitors' intranet systems, it would be difficult for a business to obtain specific information about the ways in which its competitors' intranet systems work. Developing product standards will not provide a business with information about a competitor's activities. Communication barriers are problems that interfere with the effective exchange of information."

Key performance indicators are not necessarily aligned with a business's operating expenses, corporate culture, or payroll and benefits."

Requiring employees to sign non-disclosure agreements can help prevent former employees from sharing confidential knowledge with competitors. Requiring employees to maintain records of key knowledge does nothing to prevent them from sharing it. Patents and copyright registrations can protect formal product designs and proprietary information, but they do not provide the legal incentive to prevent former employees from sharing confidential information. Maintaining access to legal services does not help prevent former employees from sharing information."

1287,ENTREPRENEURSHIP EXAM,Entrepreneurship Sample Exam.pdf,20,Which of the following decreases as production increases in a business that has economies of scale:,Income taxes,Pay rates,Net profits,Fixed costs,D,Fixed costs,"Fixed costs. Economies of scale are characteristics that allow a business to increase output without experiencing a comparable increase in the cost of production. The fixed costs of production are spread over more units so the overall cost of producing more and more products actually decreases. For example, once an electric plant is built, the cost of producing electricity decreases because the cost of building the facility is spread over more and more units of electricity. In a business that has economies of scale, net profits may increase, which will lead to an increase in income tax. Pay rates usually do not decrease as a result of economies of scale."

In other words, knowledge and learning lead to",leadership.,innovation.,complacency.,curiosity.,B,innovation.,"Innovation. Innovation, the creation or discovery of something new, such as a new product, strategy, or process, is closely tied to knowledge and learning. When employees are constantly learning at work, they are more likely to innovate. They are not more likely to become complacent, which means feeling satisfied with less-than-stellar performance. Learning and knowledge may also lead to greater curiosity and leadership, but this example specifically references innovation."

A company's sales team generates a great deal of useful data for marketers, as salespeople keep records that can show marketers things such as who the company's current and potential customers are, what current and potential customers want, and data about completed sales. Updates on current trends in the marketing industry would not come from a sales team, but from the news, online publications, blogs, or trade journals.

Corporate governance is the system by which directors handle their responsibility toward shareholders. It includes the techniques used to direct and manage a company, usually conducted by the board of directors. One of the roles of corporate governance is to keep one person in an organization from exerting too much control. This ensures fairness and accountability to stakeholders. It is not true that small businesses have no need for formal corporate governance; organizations of all sizes can benefit from it.

Businesses often compare their income from sales and the cost of buying those goods to the industry standard in order to determine if they are spending too much based on the profit earned. If the industry standard is 25% gross profit, a business wants to make sure that it is earning that amount. To calculate the percentage of gross profit, first subtract the cost of goods sold from annual sales to determine gross profit ($500,000 - $400,000 = $100,000). Then, divide that figure by annual sales ($100,000 ÷ $500,000 = .20). Convert that figure to a percentage by multiplying by 100 (.20 X 100 = 20%). In this case, the business is earning 20% gross profit which is 5% lower than the industry standard."

Because accounts receivable is an accounting activity that involves collecting payment for the goods and services that the business offers, a purchase order is not an accounts-receivable document.

Elastic demand is a form of demand in which changes in price correspond to changes in demand. Even a small change in price affects demand for the product. As a result, hotel chains carefully analyze economic conditions and the competition to make sure a price increase will not reduce demand. If customers feel the new price is too high, they will not buy because hotel rooms are products that customers do not need in order to survive.
