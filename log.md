## Session 2025-09-15-001 (Two Study Modes Implementation)

### Session Context
- **Started**: 2025-09-15
- **Task**: Implement Critical Fix - Two Study Modes (Test vs Review)
- **Issue**: App currently loads ALL questions without spaced repetition option
- **Goal**: Add Test All vs Study (25) modes to Topic Selector

### Current Plan
Implementing 4-phase approach per TODO:
1. **Phase 1**: Update Topic Selector UI with dual buttons âœ…
2. **Phase 2**: Add session settings to InfoHelp component âœ…
3. **Phase 3**: Update API and session logic for study modes âœ…
4. **Phase 4**: Polish with mode indicators and completion feedback âœ…

### Actions Taken

#### Phase 1: Topic Selector UI
- âœ… Updated TopicSelector to show two buttons: "Test All" and "Study (25)"
- âœ… Added mode parameter to onTopicsSelected callback
- âœ… Updated store to track studySessionSize and lastStudyMode
- âœ… Added visual separation with "or" text between buttons
- âœ… Added help text explaining the difference between modes

#### Phase 2: Session Settings in InfoHelp
- âœ… Added Session Settings section with study session size control
- âœ… Added number input with 5-100 range validation
- âœ… Added preset buttons for quick selection (10, 25, 50, 100)
- âœ… Added clear explanation of Test All vs Study modes
- âœ… Settings persist via localStorage through Zustand store

#### Phase 3: API and Session Logic
- âœ… Updated /api/questions to accept mode and limit parameters
- âœ… Implemented spaced repetition filtering for Study mode:
  - Prioritizes overdue questions first
  - Then due today questions
  - Finally new questions to fill remaining slots
- âœ… Updated useStudySession hook to pass mode and limit
- âœ… Updated StudySession and StudySessionMobile components to accept mode/limit props
- âœ… Fixed TypeScript null check for nextReview date

#### Phase 4: Polish and Feedback
- âœ… Added mode indicators in study session headers (both desktop and mobile)
- âœ… Different colors: blue for Test All, primary color for Study
- âœ… Customized completion messages based on mode:
  - Test: "Test complete! Score: X/Y (Z%)"
  - Study: "Study session complete! Reviewed X questions (Y% correct)"
- âœ… Mode indicator shows throughout session for clarity

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Store Updates
- Added studySessionSize (default: 25)
- Added lastStudyMode to remember user preference
- Both values persist via localStorage

#### API Enhancement
- Mode parameter: 'test' or 'study'
- Limit parameter: number of questions for study mode
- Study mode uses getUserFromRequest for user-specific filtering
- Efficient prioritization algorithm for spaced repetition

#### Component Updates
- TopicSelector: Dual button UI with dynamic session size display

## Session: Mastery System Analysis & Planning - September 16, 2025

### Issue Analysis
**Problem**: Users can't clearly understand when they've truly mastered a question. The current "review" state doesn't communicate mastery level, and users don't know when content is in their long-term memory.

**Key Questions Addressed**:
1. Why do we need so many variables in the spaced repetition system?
2. When can a user know that a question is in long-term memory?
3. How can we simplify the system while maintaining functionality?

### Research & Analysis
1. âœ… **Analyzed current variable system** - Identified 11 variables with redundancy
2. âœ… **Researched other tools** - Compared with Anki, SuperMemo, and simpler systems
3. âœ… **Identified simplification opportunities** - Can reduce from 11 to 8 variables
4. âœ… **Analyzed mastery criteria** - Current system has good logic but poor communication

### Key Findings
**Variable Redundancy**:
- `timesAnswered` vs `repetitions` - Can derive from session history
- `lastAnswered` vs `lastReviewDate` - Complete duplicates
- `timesCorrect` - Only used for stats, can be calculated

**Mastery Communication Issues**:
- "Review" state doesn't indicate mastery level
- "Guru" and "Master" statuses buried in UI
- No clear progression from learning to mastery
- Users don't understand when content is truly mastered

**Current Mastery Criteria** (Good logic, poor communication):
- **New**: Never attempted
- **Apprentice**: Learning/relearning OR repetitions < 3
- **Guru**: 3+ repetitions, ease factor â‰¥ 2.3, interval < 21 days
- **Master**: 3+ repetitions, ease factor â‰¥ 2.3, interval â‰¥ 21 days

### Solution Design
**Enhanced Mastery System**:
1. **Clear State Display**: New â†’ Learning â†’ Guru â†’ Master
2. **Visual Indicators**: Colors, icons, progress bars
3. **User Feedback**: Celebration messages for achievements
4. **Next Review Info**: Clear timing for when questions appear again

**Simplified Variables** (Keep 4 states, reduce redundancy):
- Keep: `interval`, `easeFactor`, `repetitions`, `state`, `currentStep`, `nextReview`, `lastReviewDate`, `lapses`
- Remove: `timesAnswered`, `timesCorrect`, `lastAnswered`

### Documentation Created
1. **Mastery System Improvements Document**: `docs/MASTERY_SYSTEM_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
   - Comprehensive analysis of current system
   - Detailed improvement proposals
   - Implementation plan with 4 phases
   - Success criteria and examples

2. **TODO.md Updated**: Added planned mastery system improvements section
   - References the detailed document
   - Outlines key issues and improvements
   - Provides implementation phases

### Next Steps
- **Phase 1**: Implement core mastery logic and state display
- **Phase 2**: Update UI components (Browse, Dashboard, StudySession)
- **Phase 3**: Add enhanced feedback and progress indicators
- **Phase 4**: Testing and polish

*Mastery system analysis completed and documented for future implementation*
