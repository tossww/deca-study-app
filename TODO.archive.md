# DECA Study App - TODO Archive

*This file contains completed tasks and cleanup phases that are no longer active*

## üéØ **Completed Major Features (January 2025)**
‚úÖ **COMPLETED MAJOR FEATURES:**
- **Full Anki Algorithm** - Complete spaced repetition system with learning states
- **Mobile-First Experience** - Separate touch-optimized mobile components
- **Time-Based Grading** - Auto-suggestion based on response time
- **Advanced UI/UX** - No-scroll study page, mobile header hiding, gesture support

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Answer Submission Bug Fix - September 16, 2025

### Issue Resolved
Fixed bug where clicking a correct answer didn't update repetition variables because the 4-second auto-grade timer was being cleared when users clicked "Continue".

### Root Cause
- Answer submission was delayed by a 4-second timer
- Clicking "Continue" cleared the timer without submitting the answer
- Only users who waited 4+ seconds or clicked "Adjust" had their answers saved

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed the 4-second timer** - Answers now submit immediately with the suggested grade
2. **Fixed adjust button behavior** - Adjustments now always calculate from the baseline state (before initial submission)
3. **Prevented cumulative changes** - Multiple clicks on "Adjust" no longer apply cumulative changes

### Technical Changes
- Modified `handleAnswer` to submit answer immediately instead of setting a timer
- Added `submitted` and `submittedGrade` fields to track baseline state
- Updated `submitAnswer` to always use baseline grade for score adjustments
- Removed all `autoGradeTimer` related code

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Two Study Modes (Test vs Review) - September 15, 2025

### Issue Resolved
The app now offers two distinct study modes:
- **Test All**: Practice all questions from selected topics (original behavior)
- **Study Mode**: Limited sessions using spaced repetition (configurable 5-100 questions)

### Implementation Summary

#### Phase 1 ‚Äì Topic Selector UI Update ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Replaced single "Start Study" button with "Test All" and "Study (25)" options
- ‚úÖ Pass study mode ('test' or 'study') to session component
- ‚úÖ Show configurable count on Study button
- ‚úÖ Store last selected mode in localStorage

#### Phase 2 ‚Äì Settings in Info Panel ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Added "Session Settings" section to InfoHelp component
- ‚úÖ Added number input for study session size (min: 5, max: 100, default: 25)
- ‚úÖ Save preference to localStorage via store
- ‚úÖ Update Study button label dynamically with saved preference
- ‚úÖ Added clear explanation of difference between Test and Study modes

#### Phase 3 ‚Äì API & Session Logic ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Updated `/api/questions` endpoint to accept `mode` and `limit` parameters
- ‚úÖ Test mode: returns all questions (maintains original behavior)
- ‚úÖ Study mode implementation:
  - ‚úÖ Filter by nextReview <= today for reviews
  - ‚úÖ Include new questions (never answered)
  - ‚úÖ Priority: overdue > due today > new
  - ‚úÖ Limit to requested session size
- ‚úÖ Updated useStudySession hook to pass mode and limit

#### Phase 4 ‚Äì Polish & Feedback ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Show mode indicator in study session header (blue for Test, primary for Study)
- ‚úÖ Different completion messages for Test vs Study
- ‚úÖ Mode indicators on both desktop and mobile interfaces

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Cheating Mode Feature - September 15, 2025

### Feature Overview
Added a "Cheating Mode" option that removes the period from the correct answer's number to make it easier to identify during practice sessions.

### Implementation Details
- ‚úÖ Added `cheatingMode` boolean state to the global store
- ‚úÖ Added cheating mode toggle in the InfoHelp component's Session Settings section
- ‚úÖ Updated StudySession component to conditionally hide period for correct answer when cheating mode is enabled
- ‚úÖ Updated StudySessionMobile component to conditionally hide period for correct answer when cheating mode is enabled
- ‚úÖ Cheating mode state persists across sessions via localStorage

### How It Works
- When cheating mode is OFF: All answer options show as "1.", "2.", "3.", "4."
- When cheating mode is ON: The correct answer shows without period (e.g., "1" instead of "1.")
- Toggle is available in the Info/Help panel under Session Settings
- Warning message displays when cheating mode is active

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Randomize Multiple-Choice Positions - September 16, 2025

### Feature Overview
Implemented randomization of answer positions for multiple-choice questions to prevent memorization of answer positions.

### Implementation Details
- ‚úÖ Added Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to `/api/questions/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ Randomizes option positions while maintaining correct answer tracking
- ‚úÖ Each question gets unique random order on every fetch
- ‚úÖ Works seamlessly with existing frontend components

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Version Info Display - September 16, 2025

### Feature Overview
Added version number and timestamp display at the top of the Info page for easy version identification.

### Implementation Details
- ‚úÖ Created `/api/build-info` endpoint for dynamic build information
- ‚úÖ Shows version number (v1.0.1) and load timestamp
- ‚úÖ Clean, minimal design with monospace font
- ‚úÖ Displays git branch and commit info when available
